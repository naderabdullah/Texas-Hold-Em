# Texas-Hold-Em
Poker Game Prototype
prototype folder contains all classes for the Texas Hold' Em style Poker game made completely in Java. 

GUI is still WIP and not functional at all. To play the game, you simply run the main class and it should work as intended.
Music is also WIP and could be added in later.

Game functions with one player against 4 other AIs. AIs are named after developers and make decisions based on a behind-the-scenes number that goes up and down depending on the cards being dealt. 

I mainly worked on AI decision making based on hand evaluation, the main loop of the game, and other game planning decisions.

Credits to Jack Griffin for all of the actual AI hand evaluation and game planning.
